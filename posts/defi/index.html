Users can lend or borrow assets through these markets, and earn interest on their deposits.\nSounds familiar to you? Probably so, because that’s the basic definition of loans.\nSo, why should you go through the trouble of using Aave, possibly with stable coins (crypto assets pegged to the US Dollar), instead of just using the services offered by your bank?\nI’ll let the numbers do the talk:\nAccording to Investopedia, as of September 2020, the highest bank yearly interest rates are around 1.00% to 1.10% Currently, Aave offers around 12% yearly returns on the stablecoin DAI. The Bleeding Edge From a theoretical standpoint, DeFi sounds awesome.\nIt offers much, much better returns than traditional finance and it’s only getting started!\nSo, what’s the drawdown?\nWell, like many technological innovations, DeFi is considered to be on the bleeding edge of crypto and Web3.\nBleeding edge technology is a category of technologies so new that they could have a high risk of being unreliable and lead adopters to incur greater expense in order to make use of them.\nWhat does this mean?\nFor starters, that you should be extremely careful when using DeFi dApps.\nLike all bleeding edge technologies, DeFi consists of experimental tech that hasn’t really passed the test of time.\nGiven how much money is locked in these protocols (as of September 2020, over 8 billion USD!), hackers are incentivized to look for bugs to exploit, and new scams are perpetrated each day.\nFor example, last June the DeFi protocol Balancer was hacked for over $500.000 in cryptocurrencies.\nBut this is the risk that it takes to be on the bleeding edge.\nVenture capitals like Three Arrows Capital and single investors that have decided to speculate on Decentralized Finance have decided to face these risks, and have experienced tremendous returns in the past year.\nFor instance, the Aave token has experienced a rise in its market price of an outstanding 4000% in the past year.\nThe DeFi VIPs To end this blog post, if you’re interested in learning more about DeFi, I highly suggest watching the DeFi Roundtable from Smartcon 2020 to see what the DeFi industry leaders think of the current state of Decentralized Finance.\n","wordCount":"495","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Paolo
