    <p>Decentralized Finance (also known as <strong>DeFi</strong>) is <em>an ecosystem of financial applications built on top of blockchain networks</em>.<br />
But what does this mean?</p>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with modern blockchain applications such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/">Ethereum’s Decentralized Applications</a> (or dApps), think of them as open source, distributed applications or services that are accessible by anyone that has access to the internet and has an Ethereum wallet.<br />
The DeFi ecosystem is made of dozens of different dApps that share the objecting of porting and improving financial instruments to the blockchain.</p>

<p>This probably sounds very vague to anyone that isn’t familiar with dApps, so let’s look into a DeFi application.</p>

<h1 id="aave-protocol---money-markets-on-the-ethereum-blockchain">Aave Protocol - Money Markets on the Ethereum blockchain</h1>

<p><a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a> is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables the creation of money markets. Users can lend or borrow assets through these markets, and earn interest on their deposits.</p>

<p>Sounds familiar to you? Probably so, because that’s the basic definition of loans.</p>

<p>So, why should you go through the trouble of using Aave, possibly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin">stable coins</a> (crypto assets pegged to the US Dollar), instead of just using the services offered by your bank?</p>

<p>I’ll let the numbers do the talk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/banks-pay-highest-interest-rates-savings-accounts/">Investopedia</a>, as of September 2020, the highest bank yearly interest rates are around 1.00% to 1.10%</li>
  <li>Currently, Aave offers around <a href="https://app.aave.com/home">12% yearly returns</a> on the stablecoin DAI.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-bleeding-edge">The Bleeding Edge</h1>

<p>From a theoretical standpoint, DeFi sounds awesome.<br />
It offers much, much better returns than traditional finance and it’s only getting started!</p>

<p>So, what’s the drawdown?</p>

<p>Well, like many technological innovations, DeFi is considered to be on the bleeding edge of crypto and Web3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bleeding edge technology is a category of technologies so new that they could have a high risk of being unreliable and lead adopters to incur greater expense in order to make use of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean?<br />
For starters, that you should be extremely careful when using DeFi dApps.<br />
Like all bleeding edge technologies, DeFi consists of experimental tech that hasn’t really passed the test of time.</p>

<p>Given how much money is locked in these protocols (as of September 2020, over <strong>8 billion USD</strong>!), hackers are incentivized to look for bugs to exploit, and new scams are perpetrated each day.</p>

<p>For example, last June the DeFi protocol Balancer was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-protocol-balancer-hacked-through-exploit-it-seemingly-knew-about">hacked</a> for over <strong>$500.000</strong> in cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>But this is the risk that it takes to be on the bleeding edge.<br />
Venture capitals like <a href="https://www.threearrowscap.com/">Three Arrows Capital</a> and single investors that have decided to speculate on Decentralized Finance have decided to face these risks, and have experienced tremendous returns in the past year.</p>

<p>For instance, the Aave token has experienced a rise in its market price of an outstanding <strong>4000%</strong> in the past year.</p>

<h1 id="the-defi-vips">The DeFi VIPs</h1>

<p>To end this blog post, if you’re interested in learning more about DeFi, I highly suggest watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT0enNGV78s&amp;feature=youtu.be">DeFi Roundtable from Smartcon 2020</a> to see what the DeFi industry leaders think of the current state of Decentralized Finance.</p>
