Hello World, I'm Paolo Facchinetti, a software developer and cryptocurrency trader.

I'm passionate about cloud and Web3 Technologies, and try to keep up to date with the latest improvements in these fields.
I first approached the programming world when I was 12 with C++, and ever since I've always tried to learn new and emergent languages and technologies.

In 2017 a friend of mine introduced me to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. 
Decentralization is a concept that is extremely relevant to the modern world and that I find extremely fascinating.

In this blog I will talk about my experiences and key takeaways about these fields.
